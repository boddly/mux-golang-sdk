Un-Official Mux API wrapper for Go projects, supporting both Mux Data and Mux Video.

[Mux Video](https://mux.com/) is an API-first platform, powered by data and designed by video experts to make beautiful video possible for every development team.

[Mux Data](https://mux.com/data/) is a platform for monitoring your video streaming performance with just a few lines of code. Get in-depth quality of service analytics on web, mobile, and OTT devices.

This library is intended to provide Mux API convenience methods for applications written in server-side Javascript. Please note that this package uses Mux access tokens and secret keys and is intended to be used in server-side code only.
